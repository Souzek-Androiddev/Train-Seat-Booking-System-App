## ğŸ“‹ Approach

Used a boolean array to represent each seat if its false means the seat is available and true means its already booked.
The system displays 20 seats and lets user select a seat number to book when a use inputs a seat number. the app checks:

- if its within range(1-20).
- if the seat is already booked.
  if the system is availble the system marks it as booked and confirms it to the user. if not it gives back an error message .
- the system prevents double booking by checking the array before assigning a seat.
